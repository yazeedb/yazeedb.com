## A Mental Slap for Lazy People (Like Myself)

### I Write This to Testify Against My Future Laziness

If you’re already someone who passionately grinds through their work/life responsibilities, then I salute and strive to be more like you. Keep going.

But to the rest of my friends, the lazy ones: **listen up**.

In my short 2.5 year tech career, I’ve already seen too many people “living for the weekend”.

Visualize their average weekly morale.

- Monday: ☠️
- Tuesday: 💀
- Wednesday: 😞
- Thursday: 😐
- Friday: 😍
- Saturday: 😝
- Sunday: 😀 =**>** 😕

Squirm through the work week, numb yourself Friday/Saturday, and spend Sunday night recovering and hating tomorrow.

Why do we enjoy this emotional cycle?!

And it’s not just professionals, **everyone’s at risk**. From childhood, we’re taught to hate Monday and survive Tuesday-Friday in order to worship the weekends.

Count how many of these exhausted Friday phrases you’ve said/heard:

- “Happy Friday!”
- “TGIF!” (Thank God it’s Friday!)
- “We made it!”
- “It’s finally Friday!”
- “Smile, it’s Friday!”
- “Frinally!” (I recently learned this one)

I understand that our culture idolizes Friday and it makes for easy conversation, but these phrases are fatal.

### You Become the Victim

By uttering any of those phrases with conviction,

- You admit you’re dead for 71.4% of your life and alive for only 28.6% of it.
- You deny that (most of) your life is work, in some form or another

A week is nothing but seven blocks of time, and whether you’re at school or a job, work is work.

The work doesn’t stop on weekends.

It doesn’t stop when you get home.

It just takes a different form.

If you dread Monday and celebrate Friday then you’re either in a dire situation, or more likely…

### Your Mindset’s Broken

I’m a big believer in the quote

> How you do anything is how you do everything

Your bad case of “The Mondays” likely ties to a much deeper issue. Be honest in answering what I’m about to ask you…

#### Do You Wait for the End?

- Your job
- School
- Chores
- Workouts
- Diet
- Errands to run
- Fights
- Doctor’s appointments
- Car rides
- Your favorite show’s commercials

Which of these do you rush to finish?
Or worse, which of these do you **crawl** through, wondering when it’ll all be over?

That attitude and your hatred of Monday stem from the same rotten tree.

By deciding that happiness lies in this “thing” being over, you’re adding cognitive overhead by actively hating your day. That only succeeds in slaughtering your determination, attention to detail, and cheer.

Kick that toxic mentality to the curb and watch your performance skyrocket.

### Love the Grind, or Change It

If you hate your situation, either love it or change it. Make a game plan and follow through. Understand that once your plan’s set, every day is another step towards something better. How can you hate that?

Whatever the issue, your solution’s waiting to be found. Once you find it, chase it and enjoy the process. It’s all meant to grow you.

Stop running in the Monday-Friday hamster wheel.
Stop wasting your boundless potential.
Stop waiting for things to end.
Stop living for the weekend.

Set your sights higher. Until next time!

Take care ❤️,
Yazeed Bzadough
