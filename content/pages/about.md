> “Teaching is the fastest way to learn.”

I've [written](/posts/how-to-learn-anything) and mentioned countless times that teaching is the fastest way to learn. I realized that you'll never truly understand a concept until you help someone else reach that same understanding.

Through my blog and personal efforts, I help other developers understand modern web technologies. Not just the _what_, but the _how_ and _why_.

That kind of work requires passion, which I try to deliver every single time. The moment I understand something, the urge to spread that knowledge and benefit everyone around me is unbearable.

I love all things **JavaScript**, **React**, **Redux**, **TypeScript**, and more recently **Elm** and **functional programming** in general.

For inquiries, feel free to email me at [ybzadough@gmail.com](), or message me [on Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/yazeedBee). Look forward to hearing from you!
