I create content for developers who want a deep understanding of their tools.

This understanding should enable them to explain what they learned to a coworker, customer, parent, or even a five-year-old.

You won’t find half-baked explanations or hand waving here. Everything is broken down using clear language, not with an intent to memorize–but to deeply understand.

I'm currently focusing on JavaScript, TypeScript, and React, and hope to bring great value to you.

For inquiries, feel free to email me at [ybzadough@gmail.com](), or message me [on Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/yazeedBee). Look forward to hearing from you!
