## 90% convention, 10% library.

Redux is among the most important JavaScript libraries ever created. Inspired by prior art like [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/) and [Elm](https://elm-lang.org), Redux put JavaScript functional programming on the map by introducing a scalable architecture of three simple points.

If you're new to Redux, consider reading [the official docs](https://redux.js.org/introduction/three-principles) first.

## Redux Is Mostly Convention

Consider this simple counter application that uses the Redux architecture. If you'd like to jump ahead check out [the Github repo](https://github.com/yazeedb/implement-redux-counter-app) for it.

### State lives in a single tree

The application's state looks like this.

```js
const initialState = { count: 0 };
```

### Actions declare state changes

By Redux convention, **I do not** directly modify (mutate) the state.

```js
// DON'T do this in a Redux app
state.count = 1;
```

Instead I create all the actions the user may leverage in the application.

```js
const actions = {
  increment: { type: 'INCREMENT' },
  decrement: { type: 'DECREMENT' }
};
```

### Reducer interprets action and updates state

The last architectural piece calls for a reducer, a pure function that returns a new copy of your state based on the previous state and action.

- If `increment` is fired, increment `state.count`.
- If `decrement` is fired, decrement `state.count`.

```js
const countReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case actions.increment.type:
      return {
        count: state.count + 1
      };

    case actions.decrement.type:
      return {
        count: state.count - 1
      };

    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```

### No Redux so far

Did you notice that we haven't touched the Redux library yet? We've just created some objects and a function. This is what I mean by "mostly convention", 90% of Redux doesn't require Redux!

## Let's implement Redux

To put this architecture to use, we must plug it into a store. We'll implement just one functionâ€“`createStore`.

It's used like this.

```js
import { createStore } from 'redux';

const store = createStore(countReducer);

store.subscribe(() => {
  console.log(store.getState());
});

store.dispatch(actions.increment);
// logs { count: 1 }

store.dispatch(actions.increment);
// logs { count: 2 }

store.dispatch(actions.decrement);
// logs { count: 1 }
```

And here's our initial boilerplate. We'll need a list of listeners and the initial state supplied by the reducer.

```js
const createStore = (yourReducer) => {
  const listeners = [];
  let currentState = yourReducer(undefined, {});
};
```

Whenever someone subscribes to our store, they get added to the `listeners` array. The is important because every time someone dispatches an action, all the `listeners` must be notified in a loop.

Calling `yourReducer` with `undefined` and an empty object returns the `initialState` we installed up above. This gives us a proper value to return when we call `store.getState()`. Speaking of which, let's create that method.

### store.getState()

This is a function that returns the latest state from the store. We'll need this to update our UI every time the user clicks a button.

```js
const createStore = (yourReducer) => {
  const listeners = [];
  let currentState = yourReducer(undefined, {});

  return {
    getState: () => currentState
  };
};
```

### store.dispatch(action)

This is a function that takes an `action` as a parameter. It feeds that `action` and the `currentState` to `yourReducer` to get a _new_ state. Then `dispatch` notifies everyone subscribed to the `store`.

```js
const createStore = (yourReducer) => {
  const listeners = [];
  let currentState = yourReducer(undefined, {});

  return {
    getState: () => currentState,
    dispatch: (action) => {
      currentState = reducer(currentState, action);

      listeners.forEach((listener) => {
        listener();
      });
    }
  };
};
```

### store.subscribe(listener)

This is a function that lets you be notified when the store receives an action It's good to use `store.getState()` in here to get your latest state and update your UI.

```js
const createStore = (yourReducer) => {
  const listeners = [];
  let currentState = yourReducer(undefined, {});

  return {
    getState: () => currentState,
    dispatch: (action) => {
      currentState = reducer(currentState, action);

      listeners.forEach((listener) => {
        listener();
      });
    },
    subscribe: (newListener) => {
      listeners.push(newListener);

      const unsubscribe = () => {
        listeners = listeners.filter((l) => l === newListener);
      };

      return unsubscribe;
    }
  };
};
```

`subscribe` returns a function called `unsubscribe` that you can call when you're no longer interested in listening to the store's updates.

## All Together Now

Let's hook this up to our buttons and view the final source code.

```js
// simplified createStore function
const createStore = (reducer) => {
  const listeners = [];
  let currentState = reducer(undefined, {});

  return {
    getState: () => currentState,
    dispatch: (action) => {
      currentState = reducer(currentState, action);

      listeners.forEach((listener) => {
        listener();
      });
    },
    subscribe: (newListener) => {
      listeners.push(newListener);

      const unsubscribe = () => {
        listeners = listeners.filter((l) => l === newListener);
      };

      return unsubscribe;
    }
  };
};

// Redux architecture pieces
const initialState = { count: 0 };

const actions = {
  increment: { type: 'INCREMENT' },
  decrement: { type: 'DECREMENT' }
};

const countReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case actions.increment.type:
      return {
        count: state.count + 1
      };

    case actions.decrement.type:
      return {
        count: state.count - 1
      };

    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const store = createStore(countReducer);

// DOM elements
const incrementButton = document.querySelector('.increment');
const decrementButton = document.querySelector('.decrement');

// Wire click events to actions
incrementButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
  store.dispatch(actions.increment);
});

decrementButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
  store.dispatch(actions.decrement);
});

// Initialize UI display
const counterDisplay = document.querySelector('h1');
counterDisplay.innerHTML = parseInt(initialState.count);

// Update UI when an action fires
store.subscribe(() => {
  const state = store.getState();

  counterDisplay.innerHTML = parseInt(state.count);
});
```

And once again here's our final UI.
