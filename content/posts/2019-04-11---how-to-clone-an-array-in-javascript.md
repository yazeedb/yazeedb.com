JavaScript has many ways to do anything. I‚Äôve written on [10 Ways to Write pipe/compose in JavaScript](10-ways-to-write-pipe-and-compose-in-javascript), and now we‚Äôre doing arrays.

### 1\. Spread Operator (Shallow¬†copy)

Ever since ES6 dropped, this has been the most popular method. It‚Äôs a brief syntax and you‚Äôll find it incredibly useful when using libraries like React and Redux.

```js
numbers = [1, 2, 3];
numbersCopy = [...numbers];
```

**Note:** This doesn‚Äôt safely copy multi-dimensional arrays. Array/object values are copied by _reference_ instead of by _value_.

This is fine

```js
numbersCopy.push(4);
console.log(numbers, numbersCopy);
// [1, 2, 3] and [1, 2, 3, 4]
// numbers is left alone
```

This is not fine

```js
nestedNumbers = [[1], [2]];
numbersCopy = [...nestedNumbers];

numbersCopy[0].push(300);
console.log(nestedNumbers, numbersCopy);
// [[1, 300], [2]]
// [[1, 300], [2]]
// They've both been changed because they share references
```

### 2\. Good Old for() Loop (Shallow¬†copy)

I imagine this approach is the _least_ popular, given how trendy functional programming‚Äôs become in our circles.

Pure or impure, declarative or imperative, it gets the job done!

```js
numbers = [1, 2, 3];
numbersCopy = [];

for (i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  numbersCopy[i] = numbers[i];
}
```

**Note:** This doesn‚Äôt safely copy multi-dimensional arrays. Since you‚Äôre using the `=` operator, it‚Äôll assign objects/arrays by _reference_ instead of by _value_.

This is fine

```js
numbersCopy.push(4);
console.log(numbers, numbersCopy);
// [1, 2, 3] and [1, 2, 3, 4]
// numbers is left alone
```

This is not fine

```js
nestedNumbers = [[1], [2]];
numbersCopy = [];

for (i = 0; i < nestedNumbers.length; i++) {
  numbersCopy[i] = nestedNumbers[i];
}

numbersCopy[0].push(300);
console.log(nestedNumbers, numbersCopy);
// [[1, 300], [2]]
// [[1, 300], [2]]
// They've both been changed because they share references
```

### 3\. Good Old while() Loop (Shallow¬†copy)

Same as `for`‚Äîimpure, imperative, blah, blah, blah‚Ä¶it works! üòÅ

```js
numbers = [1, 2, 3];
numbersCopy = [];
i = -1;

while (++i < numbers.length) {
  numbersCopy[i] = numbers[i];
}
```

**Note:** This also assigns objects/arrays by _reference_ instead of by _value_.

This is fine

```js
numbersCopy.push(4);
console.log(numbers, numbersCopy);
// [1, 2, 3] and [1, 2, 3, 4]
// numbers is left alone
```

This is not fine

```js
nestedNumbers = [[1], [2]];
numbersCopy = [];

i = -1;

while (++i < nestedNumbers.length) {
  numbersCopy[i] = nestedNumbers[i];
}

numbersCopy[0].push(300);
console.log(nestedNumbers, numbersCopy);
// [[1, 300], [2]]
// [[1, 300], [2]]
// They've both been changed because they share references
```

### 4\. Array.map (Shallow¬†copy)

Back in modern territory, we‚Äôll find the `map` function. [Rooted in mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphism), `map` is the concept of transforming a set into another type of set, while preserving structure.

In English, that means `Array.map` returns an array of the same length every single time.

To double a list of numbers, use `map` with a `double` function.

```js
numbers = [1, 2, 3];
double = (x) => x * 2;

numbers.map(double);
```

#### What about cloning??

True, this article‚Äôs about cloning arrays. To duplicate an array, just return the element in your `map` call.

```js
numbers = [1, 2, 3];
numbersCopy = numbers.map((x) => x);
```

If you‚Äôd like to be a bit more mathematical, `(x) => x` is called [_identity_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_function). It returns whatever parameter it‚Äôs been given.

`map(identity)` clones a list.

```js
identity = (x) => x;
numbers.map(identity);
// [1, 2, 3]
```

**Note:** This also assigns objects/arrays by _reference_ instead of by _value_.

### 5\. Array.filter (Shallow¬†copy)

This function returns an array, just like `map`, but it‚Äôs not guaranteed to be the same length.

What if you‚Äôre filtering for even numbers?

```js
[1, 2, 3].filter((x) => x % 2 === 0);
// [2]
```

The input array length was 3, but the resulting length is 1.

If your `filter`'s predicate always returns `true`, however, you get a duplicate!

```js
numbers = [1, 2, 3];
numbersCopy = numbers.filter(() => true);
```

Every element passes the test, so it gets returned.

**Note:** This also assigns objects/arrays by _reference_ instead of by _value_.

### 6\. Array.reduce (Shallow¬†copy)

I almost feel bad using `reduce` to clone an array, because it‚Äôs so much more powerful than that. But here we go‚Ä¶

```js
numbers = [1, 2, 3];

numbersCopy = numbers.reduce((newArray, element) => {
  newArray.push(element);

  return newArray;
}, []);
```

`reduce` transforms an initial value as it loops through a list.

Here the initial value is an empty array, and we‚Äôre filling it with each element as we go. That array must be returned from the function to be used in the next iteration.

**Note:** This also assigns objects/arrays by _reference_ instead of by _value_.

### 7\. Array.slice (Shallow¬†copy)

`slice` returns a _shallow_ copy of an array based on the provided start/end index you provide.

If we want the first 3 elements:

```js
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].slice(0, 3);
// [1, 2, 3]
// Starts at index 0, stops at index 3
```

If we want all the elements, don‚Äôt give any parameters

```js
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
numbersCopy = numbers.slice();
// [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

**Note:** This is a _shallow_ copy, so it also assigns objects/arrays by _reference_ instead of by _value_.

### 8\. JSON.parse and JSON.stringify (Deep¬†copy)

`JSON.stringify` turns an object into a string.

`JSON.parse` turns a string into an object.

Combining them can turn an object into a string, and then reverse the process to create a brand new data structure.

**Note: This one** **safely copies deeply nested objects/arrays**!

```js
nestedNumbers = [[1], [2]];
numbersCopy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(nestedNumbers));

numbersCopy[0].push(300);
console.log(nestedNumbers, numbersCopy);

// [[1], [2]]
// [[1, 300], [2]]
// These two arrays are completely separate!
```

### 9\. Array.concat (Shallow¬†copy)

`concat` combines arrays with values or other arrays.

```js
[1, 2, 3].concat(4); // [1, 2, 3, 4]
[1, 2, 3].concat([4, 5]); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

If you give nothing or an empty array, a shallow copy‚Äôs returned.

```js
[1, 2, 3].concat(); // [1, 2, 3]
[1, 2, 3].concat([]); // [1, 2, 3]
```

**Note:** This also assigns objects/arrays by _reference_ instead of by _value_.

### 10\. Array.from (Shallow¬†copy)

This can turn any iterable object into an array. Giving an array returns a shallow copy.

```js
numbers = [1, 2, 3];
numbersCopy = Array.from(numbers);
// [1, 2, 3]
```

**Note:** This also assigns objects/arrays by _reference_ instead of by _value_.

### Conclusion

Well, this was fun üòÅ

I tried to clone using just 1 step. You‚Äôll find many more ways if you employ multiple methods and techniques.
