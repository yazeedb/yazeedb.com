### What is¬†spread?

It lets you expand any iterable (like an array or string) in an array or function parameters, or expand any object into another object.

By now, we‚Äôve seen _plenty_ of spread examples (React, Redux, etc)

Let‚Äôs dive deeper into each one.

We‚Äôll create a function called `identity` that just returns whatever parameter we give it.

`identity = (arg) => arg`

And a simple array.

`arr = [1, 2, 3]`

If you call `identity` with `arr`, we know what‚Äôll happen

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Ngch7Otz4pz-fn4Vu3g_8w.png)identity returns whatever you give¬†it

But what if you _spread_ (can I use it as a verb?) `arr` into `identity`?

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*zOqJjEFQQKYC0apcga1-aw.png)

Wait, where‚Äôs 2 and 3? `identity`‚Äôs holding out on us!

Mmm, probably not. Something else is going on here. Let‚Äôs use my favorite tool for analyzing next-gen JavaScript code: [the Babel REPL](https://babeljs.io/repl/).

REPL stands for **Read**, **Evaluate**, **Print**, **Loop**, meaning, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll **read**/**evaluate** your code and **print** the result as many times as you want‚Äìlike a **loop**.‚Äù A browser‚Äôs JavaScript console is a REPL, for example. **Instant feedback**.

Alright, head over [https://babeljs.io/repl/](https://babeljs.io/repl/) and view the REPL in all its glory. You enter code on the left, and its transformed by Babel and printed on the right.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*enU6_g81MwwfvVOwllPyTQ.png)Make sure to check the **es2015** option to have your code properly transformed

Let‚Äôs add our initial code

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*6T4kT-CHKV8FJxodNDBsbg.png)

Whoa `_toConsumableArray`, what‚Äôs that? Let‚Äôs expand and restructure it.

```js
function _toConsumableArray(arr) {
  // if it's already an array
  if (Array.isArray(arr)) {
    // create a new array
    // of the same length
    var newArr = Array(arr.length);
    var i = 0;

    // and populate it with the
    // original's contents
    for (i; i < arr.length; i++) {
      arr2[i] = arr[i];
    }

    return arr2;
  } else {
    // If it's not an array,
    // turn it into one
    return Array.from(arr);
  }
}
```

Okay cool... If we have an array return a new copy, otherwise, make an array out of it. But something‚Äôs still not adding up here‚Ä¶

### Why did identity(‚Ä¶arr) return¬†1?!

`_toConsumableArray` returns an array. `identity` returns whatever you give it. We should‚Äôve gotten an array!

Look further down in the REPL‚Äôs output.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*G7duPv_fFxiObnRqa2naYw.png)

`identity.apply(undefined, _toConsumableArray(arr))`

Interesting‚Ä¶

You can use `apply` to invoke a function and pass it parameters, sure‚Ä¶but why not just use `identity(_toConsumableArray(arr))`? Isn‚Äôt that easier?

[MDN Docs to the rescue](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply)!

The first sentence:

> The `apply()` method calls a function with a given `this` value, **and** `arguments` **provided as an array (or an** [array-like object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Indexed_collections#Working_with_array-like_objects)**).**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Nh-S3PxSlsiSOs3-KR2jEw.png)

That makes so much sense. `apply` takes an array of params and feeds it to your function _one by one_.

```js
// 1
identity.apply(undefined, [1, 2, 3]);
```

is the same as saying this

```js
// 1
identity(1, 2, 3);
```

and **NOT** this

```js
// This says identity([1, 2, 3])
// which is **NOT** the same
identity(_toConsumableArray(arr));
```

And in JavaScript, extra parameters are thrown away.

```js
combineWords = (one, two) => `${one} ${two}`;

// 'big sandwich'
combineWords('big', 'sandwich');

// 'now' isn't used
// still returns 'big sandwich'
combineWords('big', 'sandwich', 'now');
```

See that? We kept getting `'big sandwich'` because `combineWords` only accepts two arguments. Any others are thrown out.

If you want `identity` to return all of its arguments, use the rest syntax to get the _rest_ of them. üëè

```js
restIdentity = (...args) => args;
restIdentity(...arr); // [1, 2, 3]
```

This uses _rest_ to capture all params in an array. Since we _spread_ `[1, 2, 3]`, Babel turned it into

```js
restIdentity.apply(undefined, [1, 2, 3]);
```

or

```js
restIdentity(1, 2, 3);
```

### Quick recap:

- When using _spread_ in function calls, Babel ‚Äúfakes it‚Äù by wrapping your arguments in `_toConsumableArray` and invoking your function‚Äôs `apply` method to‚Ä¶apply them. üëè
- Since `identity` only returns the first argument, passings params with `apply` will only return your first argument. All others are discarded.
- If you‚Äôd like `identity` to capture all parameters in a single array, use _rest_ syntax:`(‚Ä¶params) => params`

That‚Äôs one mystery solved! So what actually happens when you combine arrays using _spread_? Using our earlier example:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*e7f8EYjND8ieDpyVHXe5fQ.png)

Okay, our arrays are still wrapped in `_toConsumableArray` and then concatenated to an empty array using the `concat` method.

Once again, ‚ù§Ô∏è [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/concat):

> The `concat()` method is used to merge two or more arrays. This method does not change the existing arrays, but instead returns a new array.

Nice. So however many arrays we combine, `concat` returns a new array with the end result.

### What about¬†objects?

> Arrays and objects aren‚Äôt the same- Captain Obvious

I‚Äôm predicting that `_toConsumableArray` won‚Äôt suffice when we‚Äôre using _spread_ on objects. Let‚Äôs see what our good friend, REPL, has to say.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*KRC9ML9a5gMXHMMrwtkn4w.png)

> I broke¬†it

Whoops, I forgot to mention: make sure to select any of the **stage-x** presets.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*GqkHXygIL0fWK9lVNTE1aw.png)

> I fixed¬†it

So with that out of the way, let‚Äôs look at our newly generated code from when we entered `bigFoot` and friends.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*YVLuudd52754IGZyQLKGUw.png)

> I see a familiar face on line¬†3

**Look very closely at line 3‚Ä¶**

#### It‚Äôs Object.assign

Seems if you‚Äôre merging objects with _spread_, Babel looks for `Object.assign` in your browser. If `Object.assign` isn‚Äôt available, it falls back to a hand-written function.

I think we‚Äôll get two gems for the price of one today.

By understanding that custom function Babel wrote, we‚Äôll understand object _spread_ and `Object.assign` at the same time!

Let‚Äôs restructure and play with this in DevTools

```js
function fakeObjectAssign(target) {
  for (var i = 1; i < arguments.length; i++) {
    var source = arguments[i];

    debugger;

    for (var key in source) {
      debugger;

      if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(source, key)) {
        target[key] = source[key];
      }
    }
  }

  debugger;
  return target;
}
```

Remember, `Object.assign`'s first parameter is the _target._

```js
Object.assign({}, bill, bigFoot);
```

Here an empty object `{}` is populated with `bill` and `bigFoot`'s fusion. So you get a brand new object.

`{ name: 'bill', shoeSize: 9001 }`

So we‚Äôd like to use `fakeObjectAssign` the same way.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Lhcx60pxjdU39PglEMK0hA.png)

If you used our restructured `fakeObjectAssign` above, you should be looking at a `debugger` statement right now.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*ZQVC5MEQjOJWcTVXTvleCg.png)

Let‚Äôs break this down a bit.

Our `target` is a brand-new object, and each argument after that is what we‚Äôre merging together. Once the merge‚Äôs complete, stick it all into `target`.

Remember how I mentioned using _rest_ parameters to capture your arguments in an array?

```js
restIdentity = (...args) => args;
```

Pre-ES6 arrow functions, we used the `arguments` object.

```js
function oldSchoolArguments() {
  return arguments;
}
```

For fun, I‚Äôll do

```js
oldSchoolArguments('Hello', 'World');
```

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*pwsmfIAF7o8862kjpYB_mQ.png)

It‚Äôs not _quite_ an array but it has indices, so its iterable. We can loop through it.

That‚Äôs what `fakeObjectAssign` does on line 2

```js
for (var i = 1; i < arguments.length; i++)
```

Wait, but `arguments` indices are zero-based, meaning the first argument‚Äôs in position 0\. This loop skips the first argument!

Ahh but remember, `target` is at position 0, and we don‚Äôt want to touch it until we‚Äôre done merging everything else.

Looking at line 3, `arguments[i]` (the current argument) has been appropriately named `source`, because [according to the docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign), every argument after `target` is called a _source_ object.

Now on line 7 it loops through the current `source` and does an interesting check

```js
if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(source, key)) {
  target[key] = source[key];
}
```

`hasOwnProperty` is a method on every JavaScript object that tells you whether or not that object has a certain property. **Inherited properties don‚Äôt count**.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*hH2NHMOMyqYhUT_N4OjhzA.png)

`bill.hasOwnProperty('name')` returns true because we _directly_ defined `name` on `bill`. But what if `bill` inherits a method `sayName`?

```js
function inherit(name) {
  this.name = name;

  inherit.prototype.sayName = function() {
    return this.name;
  };
}
```

I won‚Äôt cover prototypes in this post. If you‚Äôre unfamiliar with them, just understand that `bill` will _inherit_ the `sayName` method. [Further reading if you‚Äôre interested](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object_prototypes).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*9VSyxGpMN7xHtzItSYTuTg.png)

We‚Äôve got the point across: `hasOwnProperty` only returns `true` for properties _defined directly on that object_.

Back to our loop:

```js
if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(source, key)) {
  target[key] = source[key];
}
```

If `key` was defined directly on `source`, copy it to `target`.

That‚Äôs it.

If that property was inherited from somewhere else, we don‚Äôt want it.

Similar to our¬†`.apply` question above: why are we using¬†`.call` instead of just `source.hasOwnProperty(key)`?

In a nutshell (from my understanding), it‚Äôs a safety-net against how a `source` object might‚Äôve been created. If you‚Äôd like to dig deeper, see [this awesome StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/12017703/5924051).

Let‚Äôs finish this!

Jump to the next `debugger`, and you see that `target` has a `name` property now. It‚Äôs `bill`!

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*c7VYBdARTYqqoYa59aflhA.png)Bill! Bill!¬†Bill!

On the next `debugger` (line 8), we‚Äôre evaluating `bigFoot`'s original properties

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Fm2--x5c5mv0uRJ3ESofkw.png)

> bigFoot does indeed have a shoeSize >¬†9000

Jump to the next `debugger` and we‚Äôre on line 16, just before we return the `target` object. This means we‚Äôve finished looping through each `argument` and its properties.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*S2Ndw8gpSr0XOb9WrWvlFA.png)

And `bigFootBill` has been successfully created.

### Quick recap:

- _Spread_ and `Object.assign` are _exactly the same_ regarding objects. _Spread_ uses `Object.assign` if your browser supports it.
- `Object.assign`'s first parameter is the `target` object, every parameter after that is a `source` object to be merged into the `target`.
- **Inherited properties don‚Äôt count**. A `source` object‚Äôs property will only get merged if it was defined _directly_ on that `source` object.

That was fun. I learned several new things writing this article, and couldn‚Äôt be happier that you stuck with me through all of it.

Until next time!
