## Thank You

<a href="https://www.yazeedb.com/posts/how-to-kill-procrastination">My last article</a> on killing procrastination did much better than I expected. It was reassuring to see others like myself fighting this uphill battle, and heartwarming to hear that you enjoyed my humble piece! Thank you all ❤️

In an effort to keep the momentum going, let’s talk about creating processes.

## I’m Going Somewhere!

You’re scrolling through your phone and YouTube recommends yet another motivational video because it knows how much you love them, _How I Tripled my Net Worth_ or whatever. You listen to soundbites of a dude claiming that deep breathing and not eating vegetables transformed him into a CEO.

Like all the others it’s loud and bold enough to stir a familiar feeling within you, and by the time the video ends, a sudden amp and feverish itch make it clear as day–you’ve been bitten by the Inspiration Bug again.

What happens next? Just the usual...

> “I will become a web developer!”

> “I will start working out tomorrow!”

> “I will get a promotion!”

Your battle cries may vary, but your mileage won’t. **You are still going nowhere**.

## Care to be more specific?

What does “I will become a web developer” even mean? How can we track progress on these nebulous phrases that you shout whenever inspiration strikes?

I'm not saying don't have lofty goals. Be inspired. Get energized! But please use that energy to be more specific. Talking feels good, we’ve gone over this, but when you inevitably come back down from that inspirational high, what are your concrete actions going to be?

Don’t just say, “I am going to learn web development” Do you know how gargantuan of a task that is?!

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Frameworks/Libraries
- Testing
- Accessibility
- Build tools
- HTTP
- SEO
- Animations
- REST APIs
- Templating engines
- State management
- Command line
- Fatigued yet?

I was suffering from this around 2013, before JavaScript _really_ detonated a few years later. If we’re going by that definition then even with nearly 5 years experience, I still haven’t “learned” web development and I never will.

Every endeavor has a ton of paths, and most of us waste precious time considering all possible paths instead of just committing to one and flourishing.

## Tell me exactly what you want

You want to become a web developer, ok great. What kind? Why? Do you want a job? What kind of job? Do you want a business? What kind of business? Tell me _exactly_ what you want! Once we know what you’re looking for, we can prepare for the hunt.

> **Joker**: Fine, I flipped a coin and think UIs are cool, let’s focus on Front-End development (for now). I want to become a _Front-End_ web developer.

> **Batman**: Good, where?

> **Joker**: A reasonable commuting distance–no more than 45 min. Remote would be ideal, as I have kids.

> **Batman**: Here’s a job description based on countless Indeed.com postings.

### Description

- Strong knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript

- Knowledge of modern mobile/responsive design techniques
- Git/GitHub
- Excellent verbal and written communication
- Bonus points for React, Angular, Vue, Node.js

> **Joker**: What’s the fastest way to succeed?

> **Batman**: Become this candidate. We’ll work towards that by creating a process.

> **Joker**: (Laughs maniacally)

## Creating a Process

This requires you to critically think about the goal. What steps must we take to progress? How about a project that incorporates the job description we found?

I always recommend beginners to start by making a clone of todomvc.com.

For best results, conform as close to the job description as possible.

- Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

- Make sure the app looks spectacular on all screen sizes
- Track your progress with Git, throw it on GitHub
- Not everyone will agree, but I don’t recommend using a framework until you’re somewhat proficient in JavaScript. This means you can comfortably write basic apps without needing a framework and you understand how pieces connect in a more complex app.
- Once you’re more advanced, feel free to redo this in React, Angular, Vue, etc.

The important thing here is to pick a project. Once that’s set, don’t buy another course or book until this gets done. **You’ll learn everything you need by Googling the problems you encounter.**

After that, pick a different or slightly harder version of the project, rinse and repeat. Do that a few times and you have a portfolio of apps you built from the ground up. There’s your process–congratulations, you’re now exactly like the candidate in that job description. Maybe even better, depending on the apps you completed.
This Works Everywhere
I’m a huge fan of universal principles, and this is one of them. Whatever you’re trying to do, programming, speaking, lifting, sports, chess, Chinese, you learn it through following a trusted process. EIther you pay someone (instructor, bootcamp, mentor) to create that process or you do it yourself.

Bottom line is that process _must_ be created, otherwise you’ll keep getting inspired, making vague declarations of change, and remain the same. That’s momentum my friends. It’s wrecked me several times, and I know many of you feel the same pain.

It’ll push us right off the cliff unless we slam the brakes and turn the car around. Just remember, when you start heading in the other direction this time, use a map.

Until next time!
