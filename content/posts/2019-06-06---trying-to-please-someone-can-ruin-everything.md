## You Did it

After countless hours of practice in isolation, grueling all-night coding sessions, and frustrating questions from your long-lost friends, family, and many would-be employers, you've finally done it. You've landed your first job as a developer.

Congratulations, spirited Junior! You've studied much, and now the learning truly begins.

The gig's chill at first and you're smiling more than usual. Depending on the company it may take days or weeks (yup I've seen it happen) to get your environment ready, so you wisely decide to introduce yourself to coworkers, teammates, and the project(s) you'll be contributing to.

Your work machine and dev environment are all set up, time to run!

A couple of sprints later, you've crushed enough CSS tickets and minor bugs to establish a solid workflow and feel worthy of your title and spinning chair. The team–including the more senior folk–have acknowledged and vocally celebrated your contributions, especially the first one (Ahh, the memories)!

The recognition feels good, _really_ good. You've crawled a long road, filled with doubts and indecision along the way, and now hold your head high with your colleagues. Not just any colleagues, though, these are _other professional developers_ with their own backstories! These are _your_ people now! Enjoy and let your head soar the clouds for a while.

But something just happened back on Earth. Something that, if not carefully handled, can jeopardize your career.

Expectations.

Everyone's expecting _at least_ this level of performance from now on. The standard has been set and should only increase if you value your precious position.

This may not seem like a revelation or even a big deal.

"Well duh Yazeed, obviously the expectation's been set. And I'll do better as I learn more!"

I understand that response but humor me for a second.

Were those tickets–your _first ever_ tickets–technically difficult? Did repositioning that <div> or adding an `if` statement really take that much brainpower from you?

Of course not. Maybe finding the right file to change was a scavenger hunt but after that, you nailed it. Creating the pull request was probably more difficult if you hadn't used Git with a team before.

Those tickets were confidence boosters meant to smoothly integrate you into the team. And naturally, with the amount of grit and determination you have, Minor Bug Land's dull atmosphere won't satisfy you for much longer.

"Get me a feature to work on! Let's get some hardcore JavaScript up in here!"

_Assigns ticket_

Ok, here ya go. We need it done this sprint.

"Wait, but that's like 4 work days. I have to design _and_ develop this in 4 days, so QA can test the other 4-5 days?!"

Yup. Hop to it.

The scenario I just described was a hybrid of experiences from multiple companies I've worked at. Some companies introduce responsibility piecemeal, while others dunk your head in the Pacific Ocean, assuming you have gills like everyone else.

Either way, these approaches trace back to **expectations**, and I've seen too many developers (myself included) who feel obligated to meet every single one, whether or not they make sense tech-wise _or_ business-wise.

We have good intentions of course–to make everyone happy. But if left unchecked, _especially_ in the jittery hands of a Junior dev, oh boy... Just find a bunker and wait for the explosion.

Missing features, incomplete business logic, UI inconsistencies, 0% test coverage, lack of abstraction, premature abstraction, you name it and he'll do it for the sake of saying "I got it done".

Got multiple Juniors that are too eager to please? Your issue increases with each one.

Are they without a senior? Your issue has been exponentially magnified.
