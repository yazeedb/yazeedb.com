> Let’s refactor a birdbath.

[My last article](redux-lets-code-a-higher-order-duck) described how a higher-order List “Duck” might be written. Here’s the code in 4 screenshots.

Remember we prefixed our actions with the `name` parameter. This helps prevent collision among other List Ducks.

**Action Types**

**Action Creators**

**Reducer**

Our higher-order Duck does its job well, but the reducer’s verbose! It could use some refactoring.

### createReducer

`createReducer` is a helper function from [the Redux Docs](https://redux.js.org/recipes/reducing-boilerplate#generating-reducers). It lets you easily spawn reducers by passing initial state and an object describing how the reducer responds to a given action.

It looks like this:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*JjlD6WQ5-zrnQUneETEFzw.png)

It takes two parameters: `initialState` and `handlers`.

`initialState`’s obvious, I hope — it’s our reducer’s initial state. 😏

`handlers` is more interesting — it represents your reducer’s response to a given action.

This might look scary but let’s break it down.

Line 2 _returns a new reducer_. That’s right, it spits out a reducer, preloading its `state` with your supplied `initialState`.

Line 3 uses an `if/else` to replace whatever `switch` cases your reducer _would’ve_ had. It checks if your `handlers` object has the action’s type as a property.

If it does, invoke that property with `state` and `action`.
Else, just return `state`.

Imagine we needed a `counter` reducer. Most of us would write this:

This is perfectly fine. But what if we plug it into `createReducer`?

Oh that is awesome! Concise, yet expressive. And it behaves the same way.

Refactoring our reducer from the last article may help us appreciate this even more.

Here’s the original reducer code, to recap:

The `actionTypes.reset` case is the easiest to refactor, so let’s begin with that.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*geYXrE3Rc7AQqRDD-okIaA.png)

Recall that `createReducer` passes the `state` and `action` to each of `handlers` functions. We don’t care, though. If someone fires the reset action return an empty array. The previous state and action details don’t matter.

Let’s cut those out.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*eXtpoOeFrikOQhaSHJnv4Q.png)

I’m using _computed property names_ to dynamically set `actionTypes.reset` as a key in our `handlers` object. I wrote a post covering them [here](https://medium.com/front-end-hacking/immutably-rename-object-keys-in-javascript-5f6353c7b6dd). Basically it evaluates `actionTypes.reset` as `‘myListRESET’` because we originally created our Duck like so: `makeListDuck('myList')`.

`‘myListRESET’` then becomes a key on our `handlers` object and we set its value to a function that returns `initialState`. In the end, it looks like this:

```js
{
  myListRESET: () => initialState;
}
```

Up next, `actionTypes.addOne`.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*ulsJxARQjbnwQn1dtGksjQ.png)

If someone fires the `addOne` action, we expect an `item` attached to it. We can also destructure the action to target its `item`.

I personally prefer this but either syntax works.

Now we’ll write `actionTypes.addMany`–same idea as `addOne`.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*_UOudkm6VU_ORIaveXo-ZA.png)

We’re on a roll, let’s do `removeOne`.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*kAHo4cpfQqtMw7Hvu5fCoQ.png)

Remember from the last article, `findItemById` takes an `id` and returns a predicate comparing `id` to `item.id`.

For `removeOne`, when this predicate returns `true` (there’s a match), remove that item from the list.

In a similar spirit, here’s `updateOne`.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*gI5MRa5hxvkH5hPJbbT71w.png)

When the predicate returns `true`, return `newItem`. Else, return the normal `item`.

Last but not least, here’s `set`.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*vzYVbbsMGxtkDCiJOPiFqw.png)

Return whatever `action.items` is. Easy-peasy!

I don’t know about you, but I think this reducer looks **_clean_**. And the functionality’s identical.
