In this tutorial, we‚Äôll build a signup UI using React/Redux and three of my favorite libraries: Ramda, Recompose, and Redux-Observable. Going in that order:

#### Ramda

A JavaScript functional programming utility belt. Its > 200 functions help enforce a purely FP style. I‚Äôve truly grasped concepts like [higher-order functions](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/higher-order-functions-composing-software-5365cf2cbe99), [currying](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/curry-or-partial-application-8150044c78b8), and [point-free programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_programming) through this library.

We‚Äôll sparingly use it, so I have multiple articles on it if you‚Äôre further interested. [Official docs here](http://ramdajs.com/docs/).

#### Recompose

Ramda‚Äìbut for React components. If you want React, using _only_ functions + several useful helpers, this library‚Äôs for you. Our container (Redux-connected) component will just be pure functions, with the help of Recompose. [Official API docs here](https://github.com/acdlite/recompose/blob/master/docs/API.md).

#### Redux-Observable

If your app‚Äôs entirely pure functions, how do you perform useful side effects like HTTP calls and UI changes? You need some ‚Äúprocess manager‚Äù **listening to your actions**, waiting to perform a side effect and fire **another action** in response. These are called [Epics](https://redux-observable.js.org/docs/basics/Epics.html). We‚Äôll use Redux-Observable and cover the details later. [Official docs here](https://redux-observable.js.org/).

This requires some RxJS knowledge, but fear not if you‚Äôre unfamiliar with it‚Äìwe‚Äôll go step by step. [Official RxJS docs here](http://reactivex.io/rxjs/).

#### Bonus: Autodux

I don‚Äôt mean to complicate this tutorial, but I‚Äôm using [Eric Elliott](https://medium.com/@_ericelliott)‚Äôs Autodux library to create our actions/reducer. It‚Äôs completely optional, but I love it for reducing so much Redux boilerplate. [Official docs here](https://github.com/ericelliott/autodux).

### Setup

[Find and clone](https://www.google.com/search?q=react%20redux%20webpack%20starter) a React/Redux starter kit. I‚Äôll be using [my React/Redux starter](https://github.com/yazeedb/simple-react-webpack-starter) with its peculiar file structure.

You may also clone [this tutorial‚Äôs GitHub repo](https://github.com/yazeedb/Redux-Observable-Signup) and code on the `master` branch. If you‚Äôd like to reference the final code, do `git checkout done` and see the `done` branch.

Either way, make sure you have the aforementioned libraries

`npm i redux-observable rxjs recompose ramda -S`

Optionally install autodux

`npm i autodux -S`

### Signup/index.js

Once your React/Redux setup‚Äôs complete, create a `Signup` folder and add an `index.js` file in it. I‚Äôm putting in `src/features`, but it doesn‚Äôt matter in the end.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*NKoyAu8fL4yAbYhgc1p0yQ.png)

We‚Äôll add and export our initial JSX.

We need a `form`, two `input`s, and a `button`.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*cMpiTA4kXZbGB09nvzbMQw.png)

Our resulting UI‚Äôs pretty gruesome.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*PNHOK7lCi8DRpPA2S4ug7g.png)

I normally wouldn‚Äôt care for a proof-of-concept app such as this, but I can‚Äôt be unprofessional here. üòè

If you like, include [Bootstrap‚Äôs CSS via CDN](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/getting-started/#download-cdn) in your `index.html`. If not, feel free to skip the styling part.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*cCew4TkXY2WpqbX9EhKHcQ.png)

And add the¬†`.form-control` class to your `input`s, and `btn btn-primary` to your `button`.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*WyqTN13k3ddWhLiLevBv3w.png)

Our UI‚Äôs cleaner, but‚Ä¶large.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*d5Cr_rm0YUP9_cDwgzik6A.png)

Again, if you like, add/import the following styles

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*DcIPNx5b-NjkTxcPRJppog.png)

I‚Äôm putting these in `Signup.scss` and importing it.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*OQxZ_QcxYVgMq3k-LRIjFA.png)

Much better!

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*DKO-3QzT2NwLeqxT6vMkcg.png)

### Signup/Signup.duck.js

Let‚Äôs think about our state next. We wish to manage:

- Username
- Password
- Loading indicator
- Success indicator
- Signup response body (new user‚Äôs `id`)

Our initial state might look like this

```js
initial: {
    username: '',
    password: '',
    loading: false,
    success: false,
    id: null
}
```

And we‚Äôd want the following actions to update that state

- `setUsername`
- `setPassword`
- `sendSignupInfo`
- `signupSuccess`

I‚Äôll use autodux because it makes the setup trivial. First the file:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*awNpAGsOOHra0qE6h6kylg.png)

Now import autodux and give it our `slice` and `initial` state.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*GzlHi76th-CtBvVnPUsA8Q.png)

`slice` prepends your auto-generated action types, helping guarantee their uniqueness. It‚Äôs not that different from the [createReducer](https://redux.js.org/recipes/reducing-boilerplate#generating-reducers) I‚Äôve previously mentioned.

`initial` is our initial state. Now let‚Äôs add the `actions`.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*ImCzNRvAJIJGLUeuZkEKJQ.png)

I‚Äôm only defining these two actions. Autodux automatically creates common getters/setters for your state pieces.

Just by providing a `username` and `password` in the initial state, I got `setUsername` and `setPassword` actions for free!

Export `signupDuck`, then import and `console.log` it in your root reducer.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*_Kav6NXUAqOzjFgyqsaYtA.png)![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*6H8Xuxjsf2OXN3nK619MYA.png)

Here‚Äôs our result

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*t9Vuu1SAjJ3Uz4ld78fl5g.png)

Pretty cool stuff. Moving on.

Add our new reducer to the root.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*uSIb17TWiHmdMCv4oW5vRg.png)

#### connect() time

Now that we have some state, let‚Äôs connect to it! Grab the `connect` higher-order component from `react-redux` and decorate `Signup` with it.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*BdGM9gyOMv6m33-mdDIe5Q.png)

As promised, we‚Äôre using Ramda. So we can grab `signupReducer` using Ramda‚Äôs `prop` function.

Import it

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*YaTbCKcaLFAW5hmpUwmRkQ.png)

And use it

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Raf_M_cH1HgqjSZzAC5nqQ.png)

As you see, `prop`'s first argument is the property name to grab, `signupReducer`, but shouldn‚Äôt the second argument be the actual object?

It _is_, `prop`'s just curried.

Currying a function means you don‚Äôt need to provide all the parameters at once. You can supply some params, and a new function expecting the others is returned. I wrote an [in-depth article on currying](https://medium.com/@yazeedb/how-does-javascripts-curry-actually-work-8d5a6f891499) if you‚Äôre interested.

This technique allows [point-free programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_programming), or calling functions without mentioning the data they‚Äôre operating on. We just call `prop(‚ÄòsignupReducer‚Äô)` and a new function expecting the object gets fed to `connect`.

For fun, you can `console.log(props)` and see what `connect()` gave us.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*ZG2MZkchcY70unO_Op2RuQ.png)

Looks like our reducer‚Äôs state made it!

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*otxs_CK1OO7VSsc9tXFW4Q.png)

A natural next step would be creating _handlers_. I believe we‚Äôll need three:

1.  An update username handler
2.  An update password handler
3.  A form submit handler

Here comes our first Recompose helper function: `withHandlers`.

It‚Äôs aptly named too! `withHandlers` is a higher-order component that takes an object of _handler creators_, passing them to a ‚ÄúBase component‚Äù as props.

Import it

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*4wd7iss2a8I6-N3bBXEJIQ.png)

And use it downstairs. We‚Äôll write a test function to demo `withHandlers`.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*ubd6BQJdFqzuTHV6nxW3_Q.png)

As previously mentioned, you give `withHandlers` an object of _handler creators_, which are higher-order functions that receive the component‚Äôs `props` and return a new function. In `handleSubmit`'s example, the function is an event handler.

I love it because normally, you‚Äôd need to extend `React.Component` to create handlers, but Recompose abstracts that away, letting you write plain ol‚Äô functions.

It‚Äôs actually on my list of [favorite Recompose functions](my-favorite-recompose-functions).

#### Before you add this to your¬†JSX!

Remember `withHandlers` returns a higher-order component, meaning it‚Äôs a function expecting a base component, _only then_ will you get back JSX.

So we must feed `Signup` to `addHandlers`.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*vUPdIhFU0MWYStSHScDqfA.png)

But wait, wait, wait‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm personally not a fan of nesting functions like this. There must be a better way to _compose_ them. üòè

Luckily Recompose also carries that little helper.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*EopTn5vMfV1JBF-AJnOZOw.png)

`compose` is just like `compose` in any other functional programming library‚Äìit lets you combine `n` functions, each passing its output to the next.

Let‚Äôs refactor our `enhanceComponent` variable. It only connects you to Redux right now.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*L41jXF_rK0Iz-PY2tDJEvQ.png)

We can fuse `connect` and `withHandlers` using `compose`!

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*ZXQ2bKOYLfubppiPO3PEfg.png)

This is possible because both `connect` and `withHandlers` return higher-order components when you invoke them! Composing these two returns you a function that expects a base component.

Which means we can return our export to its original form.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*m0lP2KHYB8gOiRsSTUbFVw.png)

See? `enhanceComponent` needs to be invoked with `Signup` to do its magic.

Refresh the page and see your `console.log(props)`. `handleSubmit` is now a prop!

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*aF3-xCGxN_bGaePVUeyGsg.png)

Let‚Äôs wire it up in the JSX.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*pE1UxwW-tiP-cAgPtsyJGA.png)

Refresh and click your button.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*UxcCRhzrqY59bQU2rmlHSA.png)

Now that we‚Äôve demoed `withHandlers`, we can write the actual `handleSubmit` functionality.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*zgtLKOFBUO-eBeBmLCuNlw.png)

Since `withHandlers` provides `handleSubmit` our `props`, we‚Äôll grab `username`, `password`, and `sendSignupInfo` from them.

Our handler calls `event.preventDefault()` to prevent page reload, and the `sendSignupInfo` action gets fired with our form data.

If you have something like [redux-logger](https://github.com/evgenyrodionov/redux-logger), your browser console will be notified.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*78vOTjlZOHBQjgvDudcJrQ.png)

Because remember we defined this action in `Signup.duck.js`.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*fbd5MPnqKTQxcXhBJR3iiQ.png)

But we have no username or password! Let‚Äôs add their _handler creators_.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*IUnzDJxHajWMdlwrJHwl0g.png)

For both username and password, we‚Äôll take their relevant `set` action, and pass `event.target.value` to them.

If you‚Äôre feeling adventurous, we could inject some Ramda into this. The `path` function lets you extract nested object properties.

So instead of `event.target.value`

We could do `path([‚Äòtarget‚Äô, ‚Äòvalue‚Äô])(event)`

Import `path` (if you want).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*GC6kwYbA3e2M7ofeKdZIXA.png)

Define `getTargetValue`.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*EzT6GxXgfLUvb_a5o2fOpw.png)

Again, this is a curried function expecting the `event` object. We can use it like so.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*rdih5Lu_v_QKdu9wwTw0GQ.png)

Bleh, nested functions! `compose` to the rescue!

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*iMk_S3dlOE_u-LTKnqKgWQ.png)

Much better. Let‚Äôs wire up our JSX again.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Jlcoc9GLzlf1Bqb-vOINKA.png)

Refresh and see the magic.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*a65eonq3oADR64Tu5GVcgg.png)

And you‚Äôll see it within `handleSubmit`.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*BgGIOnhGmh5oo3AboLkrmQ.png)

I almost forgot, `handleSubmit` fires our `sendSignupInfo` action, so our state‚Äôs `loading` property becomes `true`.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*zpvkzNdwvypUWezVvk5o6Q.png)

We can conditionally change our button‚Äôs text with a ternary.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*NeDKlX8EybQFtta9z80bpw.png)![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*QkH31jxNJAuwj8ElFDghAQ.png)

### Side effects

Our app, thus far, is 100% pure functions (except for `console.log(props)` üòÜ). They‚Äôre just inputs/outputs, and harbor _no side effects_.

But one small problem: **How do you show the user anything?**

We change the button‚Äôs text if `loading: true`, but how do we make API calls or further update the UI? You need side effects somewhere!

#### Enter Redux-Observable

Using the Epic pattern, Redux-Observable will be our side effect machine.

An _epic_ is a function that receives/returns action streams.

Once we configure Redux-Observable, it‚Äôll listen to incoming actions and respond if we tell it to.

Like I mentioned this uses RxJS, which‚Äôd be good to know from here on out. If you‚Äôre not familiar with it, maybe [do some research](http://reactivex.io/rxjs/). If not, just keep reading üòÅ.

#### Epic setup

We‚Äôll add a folder: `/src/epics`.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*hG9tmAFZ_gcatZMa1VL1VA.png)

And create a `root.js` file. This is our _root epic_. It‚Äôs like a root reducer, housing the app‚Äôs epics in a single location. Our app only has one epic, but it‚Äôs good practice.

First we‚Äôll import `createEpicMiddleware` and `combineEpics`.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*SieAGIJbcjZOv6OeLcWi1A.png)

`combineEpics` is like Redux‚Äôs `combineReducers` function, and it‚Äôs similarly used.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*LMqQfS0Xc5POq3JZtbZPQg.png)

Once you‚Äôve included your epics in `rootEpic`, export it in `createEpicMiddleware`.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*xUBswBj_TfE7a3xNDbpEGw.png)

Then use it like any other middleware in your Redux store.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*K6jDiXHy-9vEkeTVTAa_0g.png)

Now we write our epic. Create a new file: `/Signup/Signup.epics.js`.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*M86le-dL-C3TMBci3hmsNg.png)

#### Epic code

An _epic_ _receives and returns_ a stream of actions‚Äì**actions in**, **actions out**. A stream is a continuous flow, meaning actions can arrive at any time. Our epics are listening, waiting to act.

Here‚Äôs our epic‚Äôs initial code: `sendSignupInfoEpic`.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*N0tqb6sSbu7LwheIMSn2ww.png)

It‚Äôs just a function expecting an action stream: `action$`. Appending `$` is common practice, as it lets other developers know that this variable‚Äôs a stream (Observable).

It returns `action$.pipe()`. Now we‚Äôre getting into RxJS territory.

RxJS version 5.5 shipped [pipeable operators](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs/blob/master/doc/pipeable-operators.md). You pipe your operators instead of dot-chaining them.

**This**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*NarC_UeP1yuaw3j0YBiVQg.png)

**Is now this**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*3NuKmzT6H6Ov6z954_tWMw.png)

#### Listen to an action¬†type

Much like a reducer‚Äôs `switch` cases, an epic usually listens for one action. `sendSignupInfoEpic`, for example, only cares about the `sendSignupInfo` action, which is fired during form submission.

Let‚Äôs import `signupDuck` and extract its `sendSignupInfo` action.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Svi0_6f50XHPqD2d5D7oRA.png)

Since I‚Äôm using autodux, `sendSignupInfo.type` tells me the action type. Now we must tell `sendSignupInfoEpic` to look for it.

But how?

A classic RxJS solution would be the `filter` operator.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*7M75FIB6Ox8sa_OJ-fCgcQ.png)

Just to test if this works, we‚Äôll import the `mapTo` operator to directly map `sendSignupInfo.type` to another action.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*R_Kx0YAO6fxoHDn6CSgNRA.png)

Include `sendSignupInfoEpic` in your root epic.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*ymEE0sfLC_xyT-dsg7ANMg.png)

And submit the form to see our epic chase `sendSignupInfo`.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*0ZDjQdzJFT-ISaulj1RVFA.png)

Our epic immediately fires `TEST_SUCCESS` after seeing the `signup/sendSignupInfo` action type.

I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs good, but remember how we used `filter` to determine the proper action type?

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*7M75FIB6Ox8sa_OJ-fCgcQ.png)

The creators of Redux-Observable recognized that `filter`ing for a given action type‚Äôs such a common use case, that they created an operator called `ofType`.

Replace your `filter` import with `ofType` from redux-observable.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*KIY3q6YxdjIcRe-8x5uEBg.png)

And use it like so

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*zCVLPinKnlpd9mYN_o1C_A.png)

The resulting code‚Äôs a bit cleaner! üòÉ

Moving on, we want our epic to grab the `username` and `password` from the action‚Äôs payload and send them to an API for signup.

With a quick Google search, I found [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/), a REST API to easily test your HTTP calls. We‚Äôll send our `username`/`password` there.

Use the url [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*gGrZSXahdR_u2OepOElb0Q.png)

To make the API call, we can use RxJS‚Äôs `ajax` function. This wraps an AJAX call in an Observable, allowing easy integration with our epic.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*4yQMe0zdtXWybLariXnjGQ.png)

Now for the epic‚Äôs real functionality. We‚Äôre already filtering for the correct action type, now we need to make the API call.

The [Redux-Observable docs](https://redux-observable.js.org/docs/basics/Epics.html) use the `mergeMap` operator to make an API call in an epic. Here‚Äôs the code.

Replace `mapTo` with the `mergeMap` operator.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*c3TgvbH_SWK49yYuPSb23Q.png)

And use it in the `pipe`. Its first parameter is our targeted `action`.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*-bJXpDYoeF9-3IcfXZJEsA.png)

We‚Äôll put the AJAX call inside `mergeMap`.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*5-mIwPjrkJhzCRUJRgjg9g.png)

`mergeMap` allows us to nest Observables and switch from one to the other. In this case, we‚Äôre done listening to the `action$` Observable and wish to create a new Observable: `ajax()`.

This new Observable will emit a value upon receiving an HTTP response. Let‚Äôs `console.warn` it using the `tap` operator.

Import `tap`.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*jss2hR9l9MFBrxo7KtVHyQ.png)

And use it within `ajax.pipe()`.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*qmtUNlLCSNMpHaiIKR6XIg.png)

Refresh, submit your form, and find the warning.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*NfhzsjE98MDZ4aS5xj4sCw.png)

Looks like our epic‚Äôs sending the HTTP request and receiving a good response! We‚Äôre only interested in the `response: { id: 11 }`, piece, though.

Luckily, RxJS provides the `pluck` operator, which lets you extract an object‚Äôs properties.

Replace `tap` with `pluck` in your import statement.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*i6BV_E6AzpWbsf_KSaDWdw.png)

And use it downstairs.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*LrPeVcN81ype_h0R5kf6gw.png)

This will grab `responseObject.response.id` for us. If you supply multiple property names, `pluck` acts like Ramda‚Äôs `path` function that we used to grab `event.target.value`.

Remember `path([‚Äòtarget‚Äô, ‚Äòvalue‚Äô])`?
We can do `pluck('response', 'id')`.

Now we must complete the _epic_ contract‚Äì**actions in, actions out**. We had an action come in, but we‚Äôve yet to return one.

Here‚Äôs our last operator: `map`.

Probably self-explanatory‚Äì`map` lets you somehow change emitted values. We‚Äôll use it to create our output action.

Grab `signupSuccess` from `signupDuck.actions`.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*L63JkbCqc_O1vMq5485_qw.png)

Import `map`.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*7Zdi9CFeKIfMeFp0o3CR1A.png)

And use it after `mergeMap` to fire `signupSuccess`.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*xmcWchI36p7-hZBRxWhkBQ.png)

Refresh and watch.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*XekctgHy6lILGsuGZkBCug.png)

If you‚Äôve been paying attention, you know that `signupSuccess` sets `loading` back to `false`. That means our UI‚Äôs button should go from ‚ÄúSign up‚Äù to ‚ÄúLoading‚Ä¶‚Äù and back to ‚ÄúSign up‚Äù.

If you like, import the `delay` operator and let it go for 3 seconds.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*G_f11d4QFaYp1wVd5lOTUw.png)

Now you can easily see the button changing text in response to the fired actions.

#### A little success¬†message

Is it really success if no one tells you about it?

Let‚Äôs add a little message in our component‚Äôs JSX.
